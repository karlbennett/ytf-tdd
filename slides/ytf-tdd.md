## YTF TDD

Why do test driven development?

Is it really beneficial? Is it just unnecessary overhead?

### YTF best practises

* [Separation of Concerns](#separation-of-concerns)
* [Simplicity](#simplicity)
* [Abstraction](#abstraction)
* [Single Responsibility](#single-responsibility)
* [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)

Note:
We think we know we should do TDD. We're constantly told to do TDD and eagerly shown different techniques for doing it.
But how often are we told exactly why we should be doing it? Does the practice actually provide any tangible benefit?
Before trying to answer this lets look at some other practices we're sure we should be doing. As with TDD, I find, even
with these we are told what they are. We are told how we might be able to attain them. But again, I'd say in all these
cases, there isn't that much focus on why we should strive to achieve them.
